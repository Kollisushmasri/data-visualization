Data visualization using Seaborn
Data visualization using Seaborn is a powerful technique for creating informative and aesthetically pleasing visualizations in Python. 
seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and integrates well with pandas, making it ideal for working with structured data. It offers a variety of functions for visualizing relationships, distributions, and trends within data, such as bar plots, scatter plots, line plots, heatmaps, and box plots. 
One of the key strengths of Seaborn is its ability to automatically handle complex datasets and generate meaningful plots with minimal code. It also provides built-in support for statistical visualizations, including regression lines and confidence intervals, making it easier to explore data distributions and correlations. 
With its intuitive syntax and attractive default styles, Seaborn is widely used for exploratory data analysis and presentation of results in machine learning and data science.
